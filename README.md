Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe using Python Tkinter
- Project made in 2019 (Grade 11)
- Ever since school time was eager to experiment and learn new stuff, learnt to use turtle.
- Uses turtle and python terminal screen fo GUI.
- Three modes for tic-tac-toe: local multiplayer or against a random moves bot or against the best moves bot.
- Hangman: option to choose categories like movies, places, etc.
